### Project Overview:
Our project name is “Virtual Eye” based on the solution of these types of problems. By providing a mobile application that assists people with visual impairment in analyzing their surroundings, currency identification, reading menu cards. A single platform mobile application will be created (specifically for android) which will have the ability to recognize the household object and assist in voice, identify the Pakistani currency by pointing the camera on them, reading the menu card or tags by pointing the camera on them and provide voice assistance in Urdu language.

### Project Scope:
The app can be opened on a mobile phone through virtual assistance. The app has three different modes Object recognition, Currency identification, and Text reading which changes by voice command.
The scope of the project is that the mobile app is developed with the help of Image Processing, Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. The app is capable to assist using voice command to recognize household’s objects in the surrounding, do text read of menu cards and price tags to recognize the text. Object recognition contain most common objects like; House hold objects (fridge, washing machine, keys, bottle, mirror etc.), Common fruits (apple, banana, mango, etc.) Common food items (pizza, burger, cake, sandwich etc.) Common vegetables (potato, onion, carrot, etc.). And distance between object and the device is the approximation of foot steps required to reach to that object. The images like prize tags, billboards, menu cards are used for text from images option. Currency identification will be applicable on Pakistani currency only. Output or any feedback will be given to user through voice and in Urdu language.
