We are using the above mentioned tools and technologies to create our project. API’s are very helpful to perform the training and testing also the storage as well. We have to use minimum space for saving the large amount of data for the accuracy that is why we are using the technologies which play a tremendous role to complete that task.

There is only one (1) screen in our project which has three (3) different modes. The user can navigate between the modes with the help of the “Android accessibility suite”. There are three (3) round buttons on our screen. The first is for a transition to the “Object Identification” mode. The second button is for “Currency Recognition” mode. While the last button is for “Text Reader” mode. The default mode is the first mode which is Object Identification.

The application will have 3 modes for object recognition, currency identification, and image reading. The first mode is, recognize objects irrespective of their orientation and to some extent their size. And also, multiple objects in single image can also be detected. Dataset have more household objects for better object recognition. The second mode is for currency identification which will use to identify currency. Based on the given picture the app finds the exact match on the basis of color, number and other key points and, after finding the highest match voice-based feedback is provided. The third mode is to read text from the images. Output or any feedback will be given to user through voice and in Urdu language.
